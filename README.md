MATLAB to Arduino sin wave LED project
# MATLAB-Arduino Sine Wave LED Project

This simple project sends a sine wave from MATLAB to Arduino to control the brightness of an LED (like a breathing light). Arduino then inverts the signal and sends it back to MATLAB, which displays both signals in real-time on a graph.

## üß∞ What You Need

- A computer with:
  - [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) installed  
  - [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed  
  - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) installed (optional but helpful)
- One Arduino board (e.g., UNO)
- One LED and a 220Œ© resistor
- One USB cable (to connect Arduino)

---

## ü™õ Circuit Wiring (Super Simple)

1. Connect the **long leg** of the LED to **pin D9** on the Arduino.
2. Connect the **short leg** to **a 220Œ© resistor**, and connect the other end of the resistor to **GND**.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Download This Project

- Click the green **Code** button on this GitHub page.
- Select **Download ZIP**.
- Unzip the folder and open it.

---

### Step 2: Upload the Arduino Code

1. Open the file `arduino_sine_led.ino` using Arduino IDE.
2. Select the correct **Board** (e.g., Arduino UNO) and **Port** (COMx) under "Tools".
3. Click the **Upload** button (the ‚û°Ô∏è arrow icon).

---

### Step 3: Run the MATLAB Code

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Open the file `matlab_plot_led.m`.
3. Make sure the COM port in the code (e.g., `"COM6"`) matches your Arduino‚Äôs port.
4. Press the **Run** button (green ‚ñ∂Ô∏è) in MATLAB.

You‚Äôll see:
- The LED slowly breathing (changing brightness).
- A live graph showing:
  - **Blue line**: the original sine wave sent from MATLAB.
  - **Red dashed line**: the inverted signal returned from Arduino.

## üôã FAQ ‚Äì Troubleshooting

**Q: Arduino upload fails?**  
A: Check if you selected the right **Board** and **Port** in the Arduino IDE under ‚ÄúTools‚Äù.

**Q: MATLAB can‚Äôt connect to Arduino?**  
A: Open Arduino IDE and check which **COM port** is being used. Update the `"COMx"` string in MATLAB accordingly.

**Q: The LED doesn‚Äôt blink or graph doesn‚Äôt move?**  
A: Make sure the LED is wired correctly. You can also restart the program in MATLAB by pressing "Stop" and then "Run" again.
